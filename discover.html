        For the season of fall I bring to you ‘Everything You’ve Come To Expect’
        by the Last Shadow Puppets. After hearing Miles Kane’s vocals on
        ’Dealer’ of 'Blue Banisters', an album by my favorite singer Lana del
        Rey, I went ahead and checked out more of his music. This brought me to
        the Last Shadow Puppets, a four member band including the famous Alex
        Turner of the Arctic Monkeys that we all know of. As well as James Ford
        and Zach Dawes who helped with the writing of 'Dealer'.

        My favorite track of the record would be 'Miracle Aligner'. Fun fact! It’s
        also the first song that I heard of them. I find the meaning of the
        catchy lyrics mysterious till this day but it goes well combined with
        the beat that makes you want to sway along.

        As a runner up ‘The Dream Synopsis’ would be my pick of choice considering 
       the lyrics. I interpret it as story where a man reminisces of his
        past secret lover. It seems that he can’t move on and wants to go back
        to that time based on the following lyrics:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em
          >‘Shoot through my mind and I can’t let go
          <br />
          Inseparable opposing images
          <br />
          When can you come back again?’
        </em>

        ‘Everything You’ve Come To Expect’ is a diverse record as it includes
        baroque pop, psychedelic pop and orchestral soul. The studio album
        released back in 2016 including twelve tracks. The LP is currently
        available at Concerto for a price of 80 euro.
